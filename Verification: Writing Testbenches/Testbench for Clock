Question 

You are provided a module with the following declaration:

module dut ( input clk ) ;
Write a testbench that creates one instance of module dut (with any instance name), and create a clock signal to drive the module's clk input. 
The clock has a period of 10 ps. 
The clock should be initialized to zero with its first transition being 0 to 1.

Solution

module top_module ( ); 
reg clk;                    // in testbenches we declare inputs as reg
    dut uut(clk);           // instance name is uut
    
    initial clk = 0;
    always begin            // by using always the clock cycle repeats
        #5 clk = ~clk;      // total time period is 10ps. So transition from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 should take 5ps. 
    end
endmodule
