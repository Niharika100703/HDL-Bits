This 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer doesn't work. Fix the bug(s).

module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output out  );

    assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);

endmodule

Code after bug fixed

module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out  
	);

    assign out = sel ? a : b ;

endmodule

        // A mux coded as (~sel & a) | (sel & b) does not work for vectors.
	// This is because these are bitwise operators, and sel is only a 1 bit wide quantity,
	// which leaves the upper bits of a and b zeroed. It is possible to code it using
	// the replication operator, but this is somewhat difficult to read:
	//   ( {8{~sel}} & a ) | ( {8{sel}} & b )
	
	// 2. The simulation waveform shows that when sel = 1, a should be selected. This
	// is flipped in the suggested code.
